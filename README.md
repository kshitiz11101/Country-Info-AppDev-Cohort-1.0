Country Information - Flutter Application

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Country Information app, a Flutter application that retrieves and displays information about any country.

Overview
The application is a simple, user-friendly interface built with Flutter and Dart. It uses the REST Countries API to fetch information about a country, given its name.

The app features a search input for the user to type the name of the country, and upon pressing the 'Fetch Information' button, it displays various details about the chosen country, including:

1.1. Country's Name

1.3. National Flag

1.4. Currency(ies)

1.5. Language(s)

1.6. Population

1.7. Continent

The information is displayed in a list of tiles, each tile housing a different piece of information.
